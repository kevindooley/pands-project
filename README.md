# Programming and Scripting Project 2019
### Summary of Fisher's Iris Dataset by Kevin Dooley
# Background & Objectives

The aim of this project is to give an overview of the well-known Fisher's Iris data set.
The objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about
it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

# Dataset Background

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear 
discriminant analysis.". The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. The data set contains 150 observations of iris flowers.
