# Programming and Scripting Project 2019

# Background & Objectives

The aim of this project is to give an overview of the well-known Fisher's Iris data set.
The objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about
it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and
mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.
