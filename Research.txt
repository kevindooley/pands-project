Research for the Iris data set

#The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced 
by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper
The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear 
discriminant analysis.

#The data set consists of 50 samples from each 
of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

#Four features were measured from each sample: 
the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.

#The data set contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns
of measurements of the flowers in centimeters. 
The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. 
All observed flowers belong to one of three species.
